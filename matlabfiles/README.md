These are Matlab files contains algorithms about Matrix and entropy calculation. 

Parts of parameters are come from Excel spreadsheets and results are also stored in spreadsheets. After the Matlab algorithmâ€˜s job is done, the rest calculation will be done in Java backend via Apache POI to read and excute formula in Excel spreadsheets and then stored in MySQL

All Matlab's *.m files have been packaged into jar files to be used in Java backend through tool in Matlab 2017.
